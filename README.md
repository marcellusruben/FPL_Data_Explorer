# Fantasy Premier League Data Explorer

**You can access the deployed web app here: https://fpl-data-explorer.herokuapp.com/**

## Purpose
This app performs webscraping of Fantasy Premier League (FPL) player stats data to make it easier for you to get the necessary data to perform EDA of FPL players or clubs.

You can choose which data from which player or club you want to further analyze by choosing the value from user input features.

Once you get your desired data, you can easily download the table as CSV file and further analyze the data from there

- fpl_exp.py: Python file to build the web app.
- setup.sh: file to setup your configuration on Heroku.
- requirements.txt: the file to tell Heroku which dependencies you need to build the app.
